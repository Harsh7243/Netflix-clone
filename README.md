I built a responsive Netflix clone using ReactJS, (Firebase, TMDB) APIs, and Tailwind CSS. This project incorporates React concepts such as routing, hooks, DOM manipulation, and API integration to smoothly connect the frontend with the backend. The app features dynamic styling with Tailwind CSS and enhanced user experience using Toastify for alert notifications.

**Important Note**: The authentication functionality has been removed from this project following a previous flagging issue with the deployed link. The flag has since been resolved, and the project is now presented purely as a demonstration of frontend and backend integration. This project is for educational purposes only, and no user data is collected or stored.
