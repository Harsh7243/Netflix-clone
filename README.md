I built a responsive Netflix clone using ReactJS, (Firebase, TMDB) APIs, and Tailwind CSS. This project incorporates React concepts such as routing, hooks, DOM manipulation, and API integration to smoothly connect the frontend with the backend. The app features dynamic styling with Tailwind CSS and enhanced user experience using Toastify for alert notifications.

**Important Note**: The deployed link may be flagged as a dangerous site because it is not HTTP verified. Additionally, user passwords are stored in my database during sign-up, so please use random passwords and usernames and avoid sharing any personal information. This project is for educational purposes only.
